# shitty-fileserver

Simple and shitty fileserver to share files from your computer. Node required.

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Create a folder named public on the project root and place there the files you wish to share

Start the server

```sh
npm start
```

Use your ip and port 8085 (remember to open it on your router if you want to access outside of your network) to access the webpage. A list with all abailable files will be generated. (You might need to restart the server if you change to the files)
